This marks just the third time since 1950 that the Santa Claus Rally has failed to make an appearance for two or more consecutive years, and it is likely a precursor to a market correction. This is all a long way of saying that despite the glaring absence of the Santa Claus Rally, all is not lost for investors hoping for stock market gains in 2025.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/01/05/the-stock-market-did-something-for-just-the-third/

Using a 10-year annualized performance, stocks had a 13% return through 2024 versus a long-term annualized performance since 1928 of 9.9%. Using a 10-year annualized performance, stocks had a 9.7% real return through 2024 versus a long-term annualized performance of 6.7% since 1928. Interestingly, the above-average stock returns of the last ten years were accompanied by above-average nominal and real earnings growth. However, using the hit rate and worst ten-year real return, the data suggests that stocks are less risky to your wealth with a ten-year time horizon than bonds!

US stocks plummeted on Monday afternoon, with selling accelerating in the last hour of trading after President Trump indicated there was ""no room left"" for tariff negotiations with Canada and Mexico, indicating that new levies against both countries will go into effect tomorrow.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 1.7%, posting its worst day of 2025, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 2.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell nearly 650 points, or almost 1.5%, as the major US indexes came off a volatile week and a losing February.

Tech led the sell-off, with shares of Nvidia (NVDA) tanking more than 8%. All of the ""Magnificent 7"" stocks declined.

March trading kicked off with investors encountering more questions than answers amid looming tariffs as US policy makers face the test of disproving investors' fears about growth. First quarter economic growth is expected to slide following a string of weaker-than-expected economic data.

Tariffs against Canada and Mexico are set to come into effect on Tuesday after Trump said levies against both countries are ""all set, they go into effect tomorrow.""

The week will bring a crucial jobs report and a batch of retail earnings that could feed or ease concerns about an economic downturn and consumer resilience. The February nonfarm-payrolls report on Friday is expected to show modest job growth, with the unemployment rate steady at 4%.

And in retail earnings ahead, results from Target (TGT) on Tuesday and Costco (COST) are in focus for what they reveal about American shoppers. Data last week showed consumer spending unexpectedly fell in January by the most in four years.

Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies got a boost after Trump said on Sunday that five digital assets — bitcoin (BTC-USD), ether (ETH-USD), XRP (XRP-USD), solana (SOL-USD), and cardano (ADA-USD) — would be included in a new US strategic cryptocurrency reserve. Prices of those tokens on Monday pared some of the sharp gains booked following the post on social media by the president, with bitcoin trading around $86,000.

US stocks plummeted on Monday afternoon, with selling accelerating in the last hour of trading after President Trump indicated there was ""no room left"" for tariff negotiations with Canada and Mexico, indicating that new levies against both countries will go into effect tomorrow.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 1.7%, posting its worst day of 2025, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 2.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell nearly 650 points, or almost 1.5%, as the major US indexes came off a volatile week and a losing February.

Tech led the sell-off, with shares of Nvidia (NVDA) tanking more than 8%. All of the ""Magnificent 7"" stocks declined.

March trading kicked off with investors encountering more questions than answers amid looming tariffs as US policy makers face the test of disproving investors' fears about growth. First quarter economic growth is expected to slide following a string of weaker-than-expected economic data.

Tariffs against Canada and Mexico are set to come into effect on Tuesday after Trump said levies against both countries are ""all set, they go into effect tomorrow.""

The week will bring a crucial jobs report and a batch of retail earnings that could feed or ease concerns about an economic downturn and consumer resilience. The February nonfarm-payrolls report on Friday is expected to show modest job growth, with the unemployment rate steady at 4%.

And in retail earnings ahead, results from Target (TGT) on Tuesday and Costco (COST) are in focus for what they reveal about American shoppers. Data last week showed consumer spending unexpectedly fell in January by the most in four years.

Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies got a boost after Trump said on Sunday that five digital assets — bitcoin (BTC-USD), ether (ETH-USD), XRP (XRP-USD), solana (SOL-USD), and cardano (ADA-USD) — would be included in a new US strategic cryptocurrency reserve. Prices of those tokens on Monday pared some of the sharp gains booked following the post on social media by the president, with bitcoin trading around $86,000.

Mr. Market’s disdain for volatility was evident last week. At one point, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), often referred to as the market's “fear gauge,” spiked to approximately 29.5, its highest level since December 18, 2024. Given that the VIX typically averages around 21, this sharp increase was clear evidence of the growing anxiety among market participants. The primary culprit behind last week’s volatility was growing concern that the Trump administration’s tariff policies might tip the U.S. economy into recession. And the labor market remains robust, with U.S. employers adding 151,000 jobs in February, extending the employment growth streak to 50 consecutive months—the second longest stretch on record.",https://themilwaukeecompany.com/market-update/march-15-2025-market-update

The S&P 500 had only recently begun reaching new all-time highs after recovering from the dot-com bear market, and investing in late 2007 would have meant buying at the highest prices since the early 2000s. Rather than trying to decide on the ideal time to buy, it's often safer and more profitable to keep investing consistently regardless of what the market is doing.

US stocks jump in early trading as investors cling to hopes that the US and China will begin trade talks this weekend. Meanwhile, it's showtime for Powell, and Trump is watching. The Fed is expected to keep rates on hold despite the president's pressure to cut. The Oracle of Wall Street, Meredith Whitney, tells Bloomberg Open Interest that she's expecting unemployment to hit 6% this fall. And earnings season is still underway with results from Disney announcing a new theme park in Abu Dhabi.

Omar Aguilar, CEO and CIO at Schwab Asset Management gives his market outlook as the S&P 500 moves toward a fourth day of declines. 

US stocks sank, putting the S&P 500 Index on track for its longest slide since August, as a six-month rally shows signs of cracking following a $1.2 trillion selloff in cryptocurrencies and amid fears around stretched artificial-intelligence valuations.
The benchmark equities gauge dropped for a fourth day, declining 1.2% as of 10:08 a.m. on Tuesday in New York, as investors reconsidered their optimistic expectations for Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts. The technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index fell 1.5%. A basket of the Magnificent Seven companies declined 2.2%. Nvidia Corp., at the center of the AI frenzy, slumped an additional 3% ahead of its earnings report on Wednesday. Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. fell more than 2% after a ratings downgrade. 
Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, topped 25 — above the key 20 level that causes concern for traders — and reached its highest in a month. Traders dumped the riskiest parts of the stock market. A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. basket of unprofitable tech companies, which includes firms such as Roku Inc. and Peloton Interactive Inc., dropped almost 2%.
Stock indexes fell globally. Topping the list of worries are AI valuations and whether the Fed will cut rates next month. Traders have diminished conviction about another reduction in borrowing costs, with swaps now implying a less-than-50% likelihood of a December rate cut. Several policymakers have recently cautioned against a cut, although Fed Governor Christopher Waller repeated his view in favor of lowering rates. 
“Appetite for AI is under pressure from circularity worries and bubble fears,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote. “The bad news is that some of the more bullish vibes — AI enthusiasm, massive government stimulus, dovish central-bank expectations — are starting to fade.”
Among other individual stocks, Home Depot Inc. dropped 2.8% after cutting its full-year earnings guidance, warning that some unsteady consumers are hitting the pause button on big-ticket home purchases. Target and Lowe’s will post results Wednesday, followed by Walmart and Gap on Thursday. 
Bitcoin briefly dropped below $90,000 for the first time in seven months — and traders are betting on more downside. Meanwhile, a Bank of America Corp. survey showed that fund managers’ cash holdings have fallen to levels that have triggered a sell signal in the past.

The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index dropped 2.7%. Most chipmakers retreated, with Micron Technology Inc., Intel Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. all falling between 2% and 5%.
The chorus of warnings about a possible AI bubble grew on Tuesday after JPMorgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman Daniel Pinto warned that valuations in the industry could be due for a correction. “That correction will also create a correction in the rest of the segment, the S&P and in the industry,” Pinto said at the Bloomberg Africa Business Summit in Johannesburg.

US stocks have come under pressure this month as investors worried the AI-led rally has run too hot. The S&P 500 is trading at about 22 times forward earnings, above its 10-year average of 19. Concerns are also rising about the economic impact of the longest US government shutdown.
Dip Buyers
Investors have so far been keen to buy market dips given expectations for the Fed to cut and support the economy. Investors will get a long-delayed bit of economic data on Thursday when the US jobs report for September is released, more than a month late because of the government shutdown. It’s part of a data deluge that will guide expectations for how quickly the Fed will ease policy.
Some data is starting to trickle in. Initial jobless claims totaled 232,000 in week ended Oct. 18, according to the US Labor Department website showing historical data for claims. Meanwhile, US companies shed 2,500 jobs per week on average in the four weeks ended Nov. 1, according to data released Tuesday by ADP Research.

Data from 1952-2024 shows the S&P 500 reaches a new all-time high around 7% of the trading days each year (that equals around 18 days – give or take a few). This points to the fact that markets spend most of the time up, not down – with bull markets lasting between 2-3x as long as bear markets. A quick note on The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC): With the 0.25% cut last week, the fed funds rate is now at a range of 4.00%-4.25%.

Market Domination anchor Josh Lipton breaks down the latest market moves for September 24, 2025.
US stocks are in negative territory ahead of Wednesday's closing bell, cooling off after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks on Tuesday poured a bucket of cold water on the market's fire.
Fundstrat Global Advisors managing director and global head of technical strategy Mark Newton shares his outlook on why S&P 500 technicals could be signaling a potential market pullback.
Interactive Brokers senior economist José Torres joins Josh to explain where he sees the economy headed for the rest of 2025 and beyond, highlighting why he believes the housing sector may be at the beginning of a recovery.

That’s critical for Wall Street because it’s already sent U.S. stocks on a blistering run to records from a low in April in large part because of expectations for a string of rate cuts. One notable exception was among Americans who own plenty of stocks, who have benefited from Wall Street’s run to records even as the job market slows.",https://www.mariettatimes.com/news/2025/09/wall-street-rises-and-recovers-much-of-the-losses-from-its-3-day-losing-streak/
